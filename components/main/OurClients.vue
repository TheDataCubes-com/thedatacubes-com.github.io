While Rouzanna is without a doubt an expert in the Data Management world, she's also incredibly savvy when it comes to building and managing teams, and truly bringing out the best in people.<br/><br/>While there are a lot of ways that Rouzanna made a major impact, I think her ability to take a step back and dive deep into problems, architecting solutions tailored to our specific use-case is what makes her so effective. There are plenty of experts in the world, what makes Rouzanna so unique and different is her ability to augment her techniques and approach in ways that I would only expect from someone who had been with us for years.<br/><br/>I can confidently say Rouzanna was able to completely transform our data strategy, while teaching our whole team how to think about data architecture in an entirely new way.
